#Signal Recorder Nexys-4 Artix-7 FPGA

VHDL vode for recorder that recieves a signal of 200 8 bit values by UART serial and stores them inside nexys 
7 nexys 4 artix-7 FPGA and outpust to pinouts at output sample speed 500HZ/50 kHz.

To install must upload code to FPGA using xilinx vivdado using PinoutNexys4.xdc file for piout config. 

Use usb cable or define new pins for UART comunication to send signal samples.
